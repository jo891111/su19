Available March 1.  
Newly renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom in incredibly convenient location.  About 910 sf.  Owner lives in the building so everything is well maintained.  Open kitchen is completely refinished.  Washer-Dryer in unit. Dishwasher, garbage disposal.  Back yard area with shared patio (anyone can use it) and garden boxes for small gatherings, hanging out, etc.
Walking distance to Rockridge.  Also walking distance to downtown Temescal and all the shops on Telegraph Ave.  3 nearby BARTs makes getting into SF easy; bikeable to downtown Oakland or Berkeley.  Direct access to highways makes it really easy to get around.  Perhaps best of all, it is one block from both Bushrod Park and Dover Park.
Very easy parking.  Always spots available and no permits required.
Perfect for couples, roommates (2 bathrooms!), young families (both parks have great playgrounds and amenities).
Pets allowed.  Water is not separately metered, so $30/month/adult charge not included in rent.

Hi. I am looking for someone to take over the lease for my 1 bedroom apartment in the southside of Berkeley starting from March 2019. My lease ends on May 2019, and you have the option to renew it by discussing with the landlord. 
The apartment is located in a safe, quiet neighborhood. It is a 10 minute walk from UC Berkeley (Sproul Plaza) and 15-20 minutes from downtown (Shattuck Avenue). There is a bus stand 2 minutes away and the 51b line will also take you to downtown, or the Rockridge BART Station which is nearby. There is a CVS located close by, and the Berkeley Bowl Marketplace is also within walking distance.
The apartment is a spacious 1 bedroom with a large living room that can be converted into a double, in addition to the more private bedroom. The bedroom has a walk in closet as well as a regular one. The kitchen area is also quite spacious with plenty of storage space. It has laundry on site which needs a key to access and you can pay with a phone app (no need to get quarters from the bank every month). There is also a driveway where you can park your car. It is first come first serve, but there is usually a lot of space available. Or, you can pay for a reserved spot in front.
Please email or text if you have more questions.",37.861338,-122.255382,"2019-02-06T13:03:56-0800","2019-02-12T12:38:50-0800","1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_berkeley-1-bedroom-apartment-10-min_6813201727.html",1,1,NA

Hello,
I'm looking for one person (sorry, no couples) to sublet my fully-furnished 1-bedroom, 1-bath apartment in downtown Berkeley for around ~6 months, starting in March and ending in August/September. Exact start and end dates can be flexible. 
The apartment is a newly remodeled corner unit, with hardwood floors throughout and new appliances. The bedroom is large and includes a walk-in closet. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of downtown Berkeley yet just far enough from Shattuck and the street noise. It's less than a 5 minute walk to the downtown Berkeley BART station, and easy walking distance to practically everything in downtown and to Berkeley Bowl and the Trader Joe's on University. Rent is $2060/month plus utilities and internet (<$100/month).
I'll be showing the apartment this upcoming week or so and hope to make a decision shortly thereafter. Looking forward to hearing from you!",37.867363,-122.269803,"2019-02-07T23:26:36-0800",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_berkeley-6-month-sublet-1-bdrm-1-bath_6814330006.html",1,1,NA

We have a beautiful home for rent. It is available May 1, but we are flexible and could be ready by mid to late April if needed. 
We have a 1930's house in the heart of the coveted Northside neighborhood in North Berkeley. It is two stories, has three bedrooms, a shared backyard, and 1.5 bathrooms. It has a separate office with it's own entrance that could be used as a 4th bedroom if necessary. It has a newly renovated gourmet kitchen with stainless steel appliances and both bathrooms are newly renovated as well.
It's in a fabulous location in a beautiful neighborhood: 10 minute walk to to the Gourmet Ghetto with its phenomenal eateries, gourmet shopping, boutiques, and an all organic farmers' market. 5 minute walk to the north gate of CAL campus. It is a stand-alone separate unit with a shared yard and laundry facilities with the tenants next door. There is room for a small car in the driveway, but if your car blocks the sidewalk you will need to get a parking permit from the city and there's ample street parking.
Tenants pay water and gas/electric. Owner pays for garbage and landscaping.
We are looking for a year lease commitment, serious inquiries only please.

The other side of the duplex, a 2 bedroom/1.5 bath which is a mirror image of the 3 bdrm, is available June 1 for $4100/month.

Welcome to beautiful Berkeley!
This is not a SHARED rental. There is no one to share with & you get the FULL house to yourself.
Because of teaching commitments I will be traveling away from February 2019 until around Sep2019. I am therefore making my furnished home available for this period. Many visiting scholars, internationals, professionals & out of state-ers have stayed here over the years. It is a small private home located in a SAFE family area among caring neighbors.
If you are looking for a bridging residence while you are visiting or need a place while you search for more permanent housing, this could be for you. It has hardwood floors, an off-street parking space a private yard and all necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. It is within a short walking distance to UC Berkeley, supermarket, BART and downtown.
It is big enough for 2 adults who are non-smokers and have no pets. As this is my primary residence I would also preferVegetarians.If this sounds interesting please write with your professional details, number of proposed tenants, flexible move-in date and contact details. A refundable security deposit is also required.    ",37.8664,-122.257,"2019-02-09T18:14:32-0800",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_berkeley-greetings-overseas-domestic_6815805930.html",1,1,NA

Move in March 1, 2019
We are looking for someone to share our beautiful new loft apartment located steps away from the bustling 4th Street district in Berkeley and right next to Aquatic Park and the pedestrian bridge to the Berkeley Marina and expansive Cesar Chavez Park.  At over 1,400 square feet, this is the largest unit on the 19-unit property.  For more information about the property and our unit (304) you can visit the property website: http://secondstreetloftsberkeley.com
We are a midwestern gay couple in our late twenties and both work as designers - urban design and animation. Erujie has a typical 9-5, M-F work schedule and commutes to San Francisco.  Logan is in grad school at Berkeley and has classes and studio work on weekday afternoons and evenings.  We also have an adorable 5-year old dachshund that loves his belly rubbed. 
We'll occupy the upper loft space and share the kitchen and main living area with our new roommate.  You'll have your own private bedroom and bathroom on the first floor - both are spacious and feature polished concrete floors. 
There are two sets of photos featured. One set is from the real estate company and shows a similar furnished unit.  The other set of photos show images of the actual unit, unfurnished.  We'll move in on March 12 and will furnish the apartment tastefully and with a home theatre projector set up.  We value a clean minimalist style with LOTS of house plants.
If you are still reading, please let us know about you and your typical weekly schedule and your core values in cohabitating with others.  Let us know about your current living situation, why you have chosen to find a new place, and when you would like to move in. If you are comfortable, please send a linkedin profile link as well. 
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Logan and Erujie",37.866278,-122.301814,"2019-01-28T21:31:01-0800","2019-02-09T11:16:51-0800","1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_berkeley-modern-loft-private-bedroom_6806457966.html",1,1,NA

This lovingly renovated and maintained 110 year old Arts&Crafts gem is ideally located in Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto; Walk Score 84.  Rumored to have been built by Bernard Maybeck's master carpenter, it comes fully furnished.  It is delightfully convenient for walking or biking to Cal campus, 3 shopping areas, BART, (the Bay Area's metro system) and schools.   The surprisingly modern lay-out, with it's open ground floor plan, promotes entertaining and includes a foyer, living room, inglenook, dining room, and a large eat-in kitchen.

This spacious one-bedroom apartment in The Stranda Building is available now. It has a well-lit bedroom with lots of closet space, one bathroom, and a large room with a kitchen area and a living area. The kitchen has quartz countertops and modern appliances, including a dishwasher, microwave, oven, stove, and large refrigerator and freezer. There's a washer and dryer in the unit.
The building also has a roof garden area with a barbecue and wifi, and a co-working/business room. There's bicycle parking in the garage (and there might be parking spaces available in the garage, but I'm not sure). The neighbors (mostly students) are friendly.
It's a 20-minute walk to UC Berkeley, a 14-minute walk to the Downtown Berkeley BART station, a 14-minute walk to Berkeley Bowl, a 10-minute walk to CVS, or a 14-minute walk to Trader Joe's. There are many restaurants nearby, and several gyms and movie theaters.
I'm currently on a lease that ends on June 18, but I want to move in with my girlfriend, so I'd like to find someone to sub-lease it to. (This will be exactly like getting the apartment the usual way - you apply to the real estate company and pass the credit check of 650 and so on - except that instead of committing to a 12-month lease, you're only committed until June 18. After June 18, it'll be month-to-month.)
If you like, I can leave you some furnishings such as a bed, desk, curtains, and some kitchenware. Or I can leave it bare - it's up to you.
Contact me via Craigslist email or phone to arrange a time to check it out.

2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the beginning/end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) Proof of renters insurance will be required.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

Hi Everyone,
We live in a two story, wooden, Victorian-style house with a large yard/garden/orchard. Upstairs we have a new studio for rent completely furnished, brand new, Murphy bed/ couch, kitchen, bathroom, table, dresser, amoire, private entrance, pots & pans, silverware, plates, etc. You are welcome to share the yard, solarium and laundry room with other residents of the household. If you have your own furniture, we can store ours in the garage and/or attic, except the Murphy bed/couch combo is built-in.
We are all very relaxed, mellow, quiet time 10:30PM to 6:30AM, ie; keep music/movie/conversation volumes down so others can sleep/relax/chill-out. No laundry or rattling dishes after 10:30PM. You're welcome to have guests over, parties, as long as you check-in with the other housemates so all our needs can be met. We are straight-friendly, gay-friendly, queer-friendly. We speak English, Spanish, Italian and ASL in the household. We are biologist, agronomist, historian, medievalist and a really friendly dog (lives downstairs). Your place is private so you could interact with other residents as little or much as you wish. You can smoke anything you want outside, but not inside.
rent is $1,600/month plus $50 for all utilities/WiFi included (fiber optic WiFi coming soon!!). First, Last and $1,000 deposit. 
Our neighborhood is called ""Poet's Corner"" right next to the area now called ""International Market"". You can basically shop around the world in a radius of 4-5 blocks from our house: Latin American, Indian, Middle Eastern markets, Berkeley Bowl West Market. There are plenty of nearby restaurants from cheap to elegant: Spanish, German, Thai, Middle-Eastern, Vietnamese, Mexican.....
We are a 25-30 minute walk to Downtown Berkeley and UCB, about a 10-12 minute bike ride, or 4 blocks from the 52 bus lines up University Ave. A 15-20 minute walk or 5-10 minute bike ride to N. Berkeley BART or 4 blocks to the F and G trans-bay bus lines into SF. Or a quick drive right onto the freeway and Bay Bridge.

My sunny Berkeley bungalow is for rent starting March 1st. The 1100 square foot home has solar panels on the roof and a nice backyard with fruit trees and a storage shed. The house has a bonus room that can be used as an office or a play room or for storage. Other house amenities: wifi, convection range, stainless steel fridge, dishwasher, one off-street parking space for a compact car and a rose garden. Most of the utilities are not included in the rent: water, gas, electric (subsidized by solar), security alarm fee and wifi. For the current tenants these costs have added up to $150/month on average, but will vary depending on your usage. I pay for the trash/recycling/composting service. The house is located in a bike/ped/transit-friendly neighborhood on a bike boulevard (Russell) with a 10 minute walk to Ashby BART and Berkeley Bowl (east) with a walk score of 82 and a bike score of 100. A nice park is located two blocks away with tennis and basketball courts, a baseball diamond and unofficial dog park . The South Berkeley branch library and the South Berkeley Senior Center are also both just three blocks away. The rental is likely to last for 18 months since I'm planning to do some construction and move back into the house in the fall of 2020. A credit check is required with a non-refundable deposit of $200 to hold the house. A security deposit of $3,300 with first and last month's rent is required for move-in. The photos show the house with my furniture that is now mostly moved out. The optional furniture that can remain in the rental is: the flat screen TV mounted on the wall in the living room, a full size bed in the 2nd bedroom, some shelving units and possibly a couple other small items like bedside tables.",37.855576,-122.275021,"2019-02-10T22:41:36-0800","2019-02-10T22:49:35-0800","2BR / 2Ba","_eby_apa_d_berkeley-sunny-solar-house-for-rent-2_6816540165.html",2,2,1100

Available: 
* 3rd week in March (tenant moves out March 15th, so within a couople days for it to be cleaned)
utilities: tenant pays pge, garbage, phone, cell, internet, landlord pays water, sewage. 
Description:
Enter your one bedroom unit that is part of a tri-plex (there are two units on the bottom floor which this is one of and there is one larger unit on the 2nd floor).  There is a split bathroom with a toilet in one room and a sink and shower/tub in the other room.  Also, lots of storage in the entry/hallway as well as below the house.  You enter into the kitchen which is not huge but has all of the normal appliances (no dishwasher, sorry!).  From the kitchen, you enter the living room which has windows that let in a lot of natural lighting.  And a door off of the living room leads to the bedroom.  The one bedroom is not tiny, but it is not big.  It is about 525 square feet.
Dimensions:
Ceilings are slightly over 9 feet high, so it doesn't feel cramped like lots of apartments do.
Bedroom: 11 x 10.5
living room 9.2 x 13.5
kitchen between 8 and 11 feet by between 10 and 12 feet.
entry way, bathroom, closet, and storage, and hallway 12x11
Amenities:  
* access to HOT TUB (in common yard)
* Small private outside deck
* Laundry - coin operated in common area
* Hardwood floors (in living room and bedroom)
* Lots of light with tall victorian windows
* Small shared yard
* An area to have a beautiful garden 
* Access to under-house storage area 
* Yard is small but has landscaping, room to store your bike, have a bbq, etc (if you are going to throw a frisbee you will need to go to the park a block away).
Neighborhood:
* Beautiful Strawberry Creek Park is less than a block away.  It has areas for bbq, basketball, tenniss, people walk their dogs, a beautiful creek, and a cafe, herbal store, and yoga store are off the park as well.
* This neighborhood was a bad neighborhood in the 1980's.  Now it is a mix of working class families and wealthy newcomers (due to increased rents and property values).  So, within eyesite of the place there are houses worth over a million dollars and an ugly apartment building.  It is in a neighborhood that is usually relatively quiet.  There is a youth afterschool program across the street so sometimes they have events.  Immediate neighbors are stable, professional, and friendly.
* Walk to BART (0.7 miles - google says it is a 14 minute walk, I get there faster).
* Walkscore.com gives the neighborhood an 89 on neighborhood is walkable - meaning everything you need is in walking distance - post office, pubs, food, resturaunts, stores, lane splitters, the albatros, public transit, etc. 
* Walkscore.com gives it a 99 when it comes to biker friendly.
*  walkscore.com gives it a 62 with public transit (which is suprising because there are major AC transit lines within a couple blocks (72, 73, 52, 51 which go to UC, Oakland, Commute to SF, etc) and it is .7 miles from BART.

LEASE TERMS
========================================================
****TAKING APPLICATIONS NOW*****
APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
http://eliteapts.com/available-properties/
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the beginning/end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) Proof of renters insurance will be required. Bay's Elite management must be listed as ""Additional insured"" with a general liability of $100,000 and maximum deductible of $1,000.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
http://eliteapts.com/available-properties/
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the beginning/end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) Proof of renters insurance will be required.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

In-law living arrangement perfect for a single occupant or couple. Beautiful views of San Francisco and the bay. Convenient but still has that untouched East Bay local feel. It's a perfect balance of being close to nature yet only a five minute drive to Bart. Available as early as March 1st.
*Large master bedroom with walk-in closet and sliding door to backyard patio
*Small half-bedroom or office -- it's kind of a bizarre shape but would be a perfect office or for the right arrangement, it could work as a separate bedroom
*Bathroom with shower and good water pressure -- only accessible through master bedroom
*Living room/dining area
*Kitchenette with electric stovetop -- NO OVEN
*Private entrance
*LOTS of natural afternoon light
*Plenty of free, on-street parking (no street sweeping!)
*Very close to Tilden park and neighborhood walking trails
*Quiet, peaceful neighborhood
*Finished cement floors
*Plenty of storage in your backyard shed
*Exclusive to the downstairs backyard desperately awaiting a green thumb
*Washer/dryer shared with upstairs
**Photos are from a previous occupant / This space is unfurnished**
*A block away is a bus stop for the 7 to Berkeley and the H into the City
*15 min drive to UC Berkeley
*7 min to Highway 80
*5 min drive to El Cerrito Plaza Bart
In all honesty, this place is awesome but not a good fit if you don't have a car. The bus is great for commuter hours, but stops running pretty early. 
Who lives upstairs: 
Married couple with their small well-behaved 13-year old terrier mix that sleeps all day (and enjoys the occasional belly rub). Everybody has 9-5 M-F work schedules. 
Asking for a six-month minimum commitment, extra points if you can commit to a year. Month-to-month okay after that. Unfortunately, per the landlord no cats. 
$1750/month rent covers a single occupant and 1 dog.
We're asking for $1900/mo for couples or any occupant with more than 1 dog.
Utilities are on average an additional $200/mo and include PG&E, EBMUD, EBSAN and Wifi.
First months rent and a $2500 Deposit are due upon lease signing to reserve the space.    ",37.919024,-122.28528,"2019-02-12T07:35:57-0800",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_el-cerrito-15-br-1-ba-inlaw-available_6817533422.html",1,1,900

Located right at the Berkeley-Oakland-Emeryville border. This fully-furnished home comes with everything you need, including bedding, towels and dishes.  
The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and centrally located. 
The large, fenced yard is pet-friendly. Enjoyed the BBQ, separate fire pit, jacuzzi tub, and outdoor table set. Sunbath in the hammock, or swing from the rope swing in the lovely and productive fig tree in the back yard. Organic blackberries your thing?  Bring your bowl right out to the source, along the back fence. 
Inside, historic features include the Wedgewood stove, Arts & Crafts furnishings, original tiled fireplace. Modern features include a second prep sink on the kitchen island, plus the dishwasher and microwave most folks expect these days. Lots of natural light throughout, including skylight that opens and closes in the dining room. 
The island kitchen is an entertainer's dream, with plenty of work space for everyone to pitch-in with food prep, mixology, and merry-making.  A flexible floor plan allows any combination of up to three bedrooms or three home offices. 
Free Emery-Go-Round shuttle takes you to MacArthur BART.

FAQ:  
Q) Is it still available?
A) Yes. This ad will be removed within minutes of payment and contract signing by the new tenants.
Q) Can I rent this unfurnished?
A) No. There are tens of thousands of unfurnished rentals in this area. My rentals are for folks who prefer a furnished rental. I travel a lot myself for work. I do my best to make sure that my rentals feel like home, the moment you arrive and open your suitcase. That's what I want when I travel, and that's what I try to provide here. While the home will come furnished, of course I can store an item or two, if you have a special TV, office chair, or some other item that you'd prefer to use during your stay here. 
Q) Which school district is this located in?
A) Oakland. ",37.844429,-122.285728,"2019-02-09T12:25:03-0800",NA,"3BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_emeryville-historic-charm-modern_6815573762.html",3,1,NA

A nationally designated historic landmark built in Oakland, CA in 1912, the masonry building was designed as an incandescent light bulb factory owned by General Electric, notable for being the first factory to employ women on the West Coast.
Now redefined and newly restored, Lampwork Lofts has 92 apartments for rent that will inspire you with open spaces soaring 14 to 25' high, original oak beam ceilings and exposed brick walls, and gorgeous windows with views of San Francisco and downtown Oakland. We hope to make Lampwork Lofts your new home.

1 bedroom, 1 bath full kitchen with tons of style 1 block from the lake and BART at the Lake Merritt station. 1029 Oak street. The Townsend Apartments
In short, this apartment has tons of style due to the vintage, it's in a great area with an easy commute with BART visible from our front door.
THE BUILDING: The Townsend Apartments, located at 1029 Oak Street, is a beautiful four-story, historical brick building built in 1917. The red brick is offset by marble accents above the windows & entrance as well as the occasional green, yellow or blue tile accents. You will enter the building through a nicely gardened courtyard. The entryway has inlaid wood floors past its oak door and Phone Entry System. There is an elevator. The basement laundry room has two coin operated washing machines and three dryers. There are period light fixtures as well as tons of woodwork and etched glass windows in the hallways. There is some bike storage in the basement. The Museum of Oakland is across the street, Lake Merritt BART, Laney College & the Lake are just two blocks away. There is a CafÃÂ© across the street and Off the Grid food trucks 1 block away each Friday. BART provides an easy commute to San Francisco. The owner pays for steam heat, water and garbage. The Deposit is $2000. 
THE APARTMENT: This apartment is in the basement. Besides the apartment, there are an additional 540 square feet of artist space. This space is only accessible through the apartment so it is your own to use. It is not living space or habitable space because it is an unfinished area. There are windows and there is some amount of heat from the steam heat pipes in this area but it has unfinished brick walls and the ceiling is unfinished and un-insulated to the apartments above. This means that your noise or theirs is more likely to bother one or the other and care must be taken. This also means that there may not be sufficient power receptacles if someone were to attempt to use it as anything other than as an artist space although there is some electrical in that space. But it is 540 square feet of cement floor, brick walled, light filled additional space. In the past, it has been used by a painter and other creative types. If you can use it without bothering the tenants above then it could be a great extra space. The bathroom has a shower and a pedestal sink. There is a gas stove in the kitchen & modern counter tops and sink. The paint is a cream color with white trim.
This is a very period-perfect, cool building with incomparable style and great location. The unit number is #47, rent is $2000.
We do not have parking spaces. Parking is on the street.

We are renting our house in East Oakland for $2900/month.  2 bed, 1 bath, recently remodeled.  Municipal costs included (water, sewer, trash).  Looking for a master tenant who will have flexibility to sublet if desired.
Hardwood floors throughout.  The kitchen and bathroom were remodeled just two years ago.  Bedrooms are each about 10' x 10'.  Sunny living room with large window looking at the front porch.  Attached garage can fit (snugly) one compact car, and the driveway can fit two compact cars next to each other if needed, plus there's usually ample street parking.  Appliances included (washer, dryer, fridge, oven).
The real jewel of this location is the yards.  We've put a lot of effort into gardening and have truly transformed both the front and back yards, including new fencing.  Looking for someone who is going to enjoy taking care of the gardens.  There are multiple flower (or vegetable) beds in the backyard plus a fire pit.  Beautiful for entertaining!
While Oakland gets a bad rap for crime, this block is extremely safe.  We have had packages left on our doorstep for days (while on vacation) and sometimes forget to lock our cars, and we've never had any problems.  Neighbors know each other and watch out for each other.
Located an easy drive to lots of great places with access to 580 and 880.  Halfway between the Oakland Zoo and the Oakland airport, about 10-15 minutes to downtown San Leandro, and 20 minutes to Lake Merritt or downtown Oakland.  Coliseum BART can be reached by a bus or a 7-10 minute drive, and new rapid bus route is being constructed just a few blocks away.  Lots of little Mexican restaurants and two Mi Tierra Supermercados within walking distance.
Looking for a move-in on Feb. 1, although something earlier may be possible.  Contact us for details about viewing the house.
Application just requires some proof of credit (CreditSesame.com is free and would do the trick) and/or employment, and basic information.  (Basically, if you can get the rent paid on time every month, we don't care where it comes from).  Move-in with first month's rent plus $2900 security deposit.  Pets welcome (although there may be an increased deposit).  Rental can be month-to-month or on a longer term contract.

The unit is approximately 800sqft, two bedrooms are around 10'x9'and the 3rd around 8'x19' Onsite laundry room is shared with upstairs, the sweet backyard offers two plum trees, a veggie garden that could use some more love, some outside furniture, plants, and a giant projector screen painted onto the back wall(!!). The gated front yard has one shared parking spot (or two with small cars). Meows and/or woofs of reasonable sizes and numbers are welcomed with $300 pet deposit. Upstairs neighbors are three young or young at heart professionals.

Convenient locale and transportation options offer an ideal urban living situation for working professionals or commuters. But want to take an occasional break from the hustle and bustle? How about a relaxing jog to beautiful Lake Merritt less than two miles away? Want to get out on weekends?  It's a short hop onto 580/880 to get to the valley, or over Bay Bridge to SF.
What about the house itself? Downstairs unit in a bright, spacious duplex, large enough for you to invite folks over for a dinner party or movie. Beautiful wooden floors, large windows throughout the house allowing for lots of sunlight, and 4 full bedrooms (10'x10' or 12'x12') with plenty of additional closet space. Wooden deck/porch leading to a large backyard allows for lounging over some good beer, or run a barbecue. The unit is also situated on a quiet block, allowing a good night rest from your busy workday. 
Other things you may care about: Stainless steel kitchen appliances (range/stove/dishwasher) and new in-house fridge + washer/dryer. Large shack in back with secure bike rack/storage. Comcast is available for 100mbps for your internet needs.  Street parking is available around the house, plus one or two driveway and backyard spots.
There's lots we could say about the features of the house itself, but we've got pictures for all that (see attached).
Deposit is 1 month rent. Utilities NOT included in rent (except trash pickup). Rent terms are flexible, but we prefer those who can stay for at least a year or more. Unit available now.
Interested? Email us and tell us something about yourself. We appreciate being able to know the house will be in good hands above all else, and we enjoy finding people we'll be able to trust and solve problems with, elegantly and efficiently. Makes for easier living across the board, and if we can keep you in the neighborhood and help make it even better over the years, that's a win for everybody!

****TAKING APPLICATIONS NOW*****
APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
http://eliteapts.com/available-properties/
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) We require the residents to provide a copy of renter's insurance. Bay's Elite Management must be listed as ""Additional Insured"" and general liability should be $100,000 with a maximum deductible of $1,000. If you do not have renter's insurance we can provide you with a link to a company many of our residents use for low cost insurance.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

I am moving out of my lovely Oakland apartment and am looking for someone to fill the space beginning on March first. We are looking for a women (sorry, fellas) in her mid 20s to mid 30s who has a steady schedule and income to join two other women and a husky!
About the house and roomies:
Our apartment is quite new (building was completed only five years ago), includes modern appliances: full kitchen equipped with range, dishwasher and fridge, washer and dryer in-unit; and is located in a quiet neighborhood in upper diamond district. It's a 3-bed/2-bath unit with a small backyard, and is one half of a side-by-side duplex. The unit is on the back half of the lot, so it is set back from the street (though it is visible from the street). The room up for grabs is the front room with a moderate closet, and shares a bathroom with one other roommate. 
We keep a tidy and calm house. We are all working girls with full-time jobs, friends, and hobbies that keep us busy, so our home is our sanctuary. We like to chat over a glass of wine in the evenings, but we also like to take our space and retreat to our rooms sometimes. We generally don't bring the party home, but friends and significant others are welcome (as long as they're not here all the time). 
Roomies:
S- (31) Professional gal who works for a tech company in the city. Relocated from the east coast six years ago and is devoted mom to Daisy.
Daisy- A sweet but rambunctious husky. Daisy is a love bug, but she can also be quite energetic (typical husky), so we want to be clear that we are looking for someone who is very comfortable with dogs.
About you:
Ideal new roommate would be gainfully employed and keep regular-ish hours during the week. We would like to find someone who can commit to a year with a low-key home life that enjoys making their home their retreat from the day to day grind. New roomie can do whatever they want in their room, but should be respectful of shared spaces and willing to clean up after themselves and contribute to the household. We ask that you not be a smoker. We'd also appreciate someone who is willing to assist a bit with Daisy's care (an occasional walk or meal served - nothing major). Other than that, we are just looking for a kind, pleasant, and responsible person to share our home with.
Unfortunately, we aren't able to take any more pets in the apartment. 
If this sounds like a good fit for you, please send a message with some info about yourself and why you're interested in the house.
Thank you!

Current Tenants Testimony
""Our time spent living at Worden Way was such a pleasant experience. We love the outer Laurel neighborhood and have lived here for years now in various homes. The landlord here was very accommodating and if ever anything needed repairing or resolving, she was quick to act. If you are the lucky ones that end up residing here, I know you'll love this cozy house and all the friendly neighbors. The only reason we are moving is because we just bought our own home not too far away!""
This lovely home is on a very quiet street with great neighbors in a well-established Redwood Heights neighborhood. There is easy freeway access to 580 and 13. A one-year lease is required. Rent is $3200 /month.

My husband and I just bought a house, so we have to move out of our beautiful apartment a little before our lease expires on June 1.  Our current lease anticipates increasing rent by $150/month starting June 1 if the lease is renewed.  But this apartment is totally worth it!  
It's spacious with an open floor plan, two good sized bedrooms, a beautiful kitchen with all new, top-line appliances and cabinets, brand new washer and dryer, huge windows and lots of light.  Check out the pictures!  Not pictured: a one-car garage with enough room for storage, an extra off-street parking space in front of the garage, and a large shared yard.  
This apartment is one of four in two-story building, and is the only second floor apartment, so it's really quiet.  The neighborhood is quiet and residential, walking distance to a few good restaurants and bodegas, and an easy drive to the Laurel and Fruitvale.  
This location is great for commuters: close to 880, 580, and 13, and a 20 minute walk/10 minute bike ride to Coliseum BART and Amtrak station.  There a few AC transit bus lines that pick up nearby as well.  We loved living here!

****TAKING APPLICATIONS NOW*****
APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
http://eliteapts.com/available-properties/
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) We require the residents to provide a copy of renter's insurance. Bay's Elite Management must be listed as ""Additional Insured"" and general liability should be $100,000 with a maximum deductible of $1,000. If you do not have renter's insurance we can provide you with a link to a company many of our residents use for low cost insurance.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. BEMG won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure the lease so that the lease end date is no later than the beginning/end of the Summer and they'd be Renewable again for a Year at the termination.
9) Proof of renters insurance will be required.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.

THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROPERTY:

All remodel work will be done during the day Monday - Friday. There is street/permit parking. We ask that potential tenants drive by the property and through the neighborhood in order to get a feel of the area and an actual view of the outside of the property prior to making an appointment.
CURRENT TENANTS:
The upstairs unit is currently occupied by a family with children. The tenant will be moving out of the unit once we start the remodel of their apartment. We have made the family aware that the downstairs unit will be rented out soon and that they have to be mindful of the noise. 
There are two tenants that have been renting from us prior to the no-smoking request. They are aware that they aren't allowed to smoke cigarettes in the building. Our goal is to make the property tobacco-free. 
RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:
*Background, credit check and application process will be done through TENANTMAGIC; there will be a $35.00 fee that you pay directly to the company allowing us access to the reports.

Hi folks!
I just got a job overseas and my partner and I need to find a new tenant to take over our lease. I am looking for someone take over starting MARCH 1st, but can be a bit flexible. 
The unit is a 1br/1bath with newly remodeled and updated finishes.  
-2nd floor unit
-has sliding barn doors to separate bedroom from kitchen area
-dishwasher
-washer/dryer in unit
-10min walk to 19th St Bart + Lake Merritt Bart (equidistant)
-15min walk to Whole Foods
-10min walk to Downtown Oakland
-1/2 block from Lake Merritt 
We installed a marble-top island in the space due to little counter space and lack of drawers in the kitchen. Will prioritize those willing to purchase the island along with taking over the unit. The island is $1500. There are beautiful velvet stools we purchased to go with it that are also for sale (optional $300/ea).
Rent is $1995/mo. 
You will need to fill out an application with the management company and be approved prior to taking over the lease. They charge $30 per application. 
Text if you would like to schedule a viewing of the space  show contact info

This remodeled 1924 cottage combines the best of an old Oakland bungalow with Mid-Century Modern decor.  Inside, it features new floors, counters, deluxe appliances, light fixtures, and paint;  while outside, the cottage is surrounded by two large patios, a shed with new washer and dryer units, mature fruit trees, and a new Tiny Home for use as a studio.  Privacy is assured by a fenced yard with lockable door, producing the feeling of being in a private compound.  We intended this as a possible owner's unit, hence the deluxe treatment throughout--but our plans have changed, and we have decided not to sell the complex.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ One bedroom, one bath cottage.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Separate Tiny Home about 120 square feet, featuring a loft, electricity, and heat, but no plumbing.  Brand new!
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Open floor plan with tile kitchen counter.  Perfect for entertaining!
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Five burner gourmet stove, stainless steel refrigerator with ice maker, new sink and cabinets in kitchen.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All new, distressed random-plank wood flooring throughout.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Separate dining room with exterior access to rear patio.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Brand new bathroom with high-quality, never-used tub, toilet, and sink.
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ New, professionally installed landscaping including drip system for low maintenance.  Mature fig tree, avocado tree, kiwi vines, and lemon tree. 
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The two large patios seem made for summer parties, outside dining, or just relaxing with a book. 
The cottage is located in the heart of Oakland's Fruitvale District on 38th Ave. Easy walk to BART, restaurants, and shopping.  For a recent description of the neighborhood, see the East Bay Express article ""The Town's Gem"": https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/fruitvale-the-towns-gem/Content?oid=23672375
We are looking for a reliable, friendly tenant for this amazing cottage.  Requirements: Three times the monthly rent in income, FICO score of 700, and great landlord references.  First months' rent and security deposit of two months' rent required before possession.  $45 application fee.  Tenants pay utilities.
Please email and tell us a little about yourself.  The cottage is available now.  Showings by appointment.

Welcome to your new home in Oakland's wonderful Grand Lake neighborhood!

This 2 bed, 2 full bath condo is in a friendly 4 unit building (owner lives in adjacent upstairs unit). Renovated in 2015, it has all new construction and modern finishings. The chef's kitchen (gas range and hood) with cathedral ceilings and skylights, ample granite counter tops and large kitchen island is sure to be the centerpiece of your new home ÃÂ­whether you're cooking, entertaining, or just having a quiet night in.
Lovely green PRIVATE yard with entrances through kitchen as well as a private gate. En suite master bath with glass tile shower. Private inÃÂ­-unit washer/dryer.

Gorgeous 2BR apartment in one of Oakland's most sought after Lake Merritt locations. Savor the incredible views from the giant bay window in the living room and watch the ever-changing panorama of light and activity on the lake.  Penthouse floor of a beautiful Art Deco building with tons of charm but only 8 units primarily occupied by owners, so it's quiet and need a temporary tenant that prefers that type of dwelling.  (Access to the back bedroom requires passing through the other; so it's sort of a 1.75 BR or just a ""Large 1BR with a great office space, etc."")
Close to BART (short walk), restaurants, cafe's and the farmer's market.  Enjoy everything that lakeside living has to offer!  You're not close to the lake, you're on the lakefront on a cul-de-sac.  Unit has reserved parking spot,  laundry, BBQ patio, etc.  The flat is the top left window in the pic of the building.
Fully furnished as in pictures or can be made unfurnished.  All utilities (including water, heat and wi-fi) included; no extra costs.",37.799747,-122.257147,"2019-02-05T12:41:01-0800","2019-02-10T10:41:31-0800","2BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_oakland-gorgeous-view-lake-merritt-2-br_6812358506.html",2,1,1200

Lampwork Lofts is where historic industrial meets contemporary living. A nationally designated historic landmark built in Oakland, CA in 1912, the masonry building was designed as an incandescent light bulb factory owned by General Electric, notable for being the first factory to employ women on the West Coast.
Now redefined and newly restored, Lampwork Lofts has 92 apartments for rent that will inspire you with open spaces soaring 14 to 25' high, original oak beam ceilings and exposed brick walls, and gorgeous windows with views of San Francisco and downtown Oakland. We hope to make Lampwork Lofts your new home.

Spacious, Modern 3-Bedroom/2-Bathroom Condo in the Heart of Jack London!
This spacious home provides luxury finishes, to be expected of Jack London, as well as design additions that make this a unique one-of-a-kind home. The home is located at the corner of 3rd and Harrison, which allows access to soft morning light, and stunning afternoon illumination. Jack London provides a unique Oakland opportunity to live within a vibrant urban lifestyle while enjoying the amenities and finishes of a luxury condo. The neighborhood puts you close to many living conveniences, fine dining options, great nightlife, the marina/waterfront, and multiple public transportation options.
There are only a handful of condos in the Jack London area with 3-bedrooms and even fewer with 1,400 square feet of living space as this one has. The home makes efficient use of the spacious interior with a large living room and open floor plan. The home has oversized windows to take full advantage of the corner location, and vaulted ceilings with sleek, loft-style exposed concrete beams and ceilings that make the most of the natural illumination provided.
Home has high-end wood laminate flooring in the common spaces and new, plush modern carpet in the bedrooms to provide additional warmth and comfort when you retreat to any of the bedrooms. The contemporary kitchen provides ample cabinet and counter space, granite countertops, recessed lighting, and stainless steel appliances (range/oven, microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher), and countertop seating. There is a separate laundry room in the home with washer/dryer plus a large storage cabinet with granite countertop. The master suite has a stunning accent wall and large bathroom, making the master its own oasis within the home. Each bedroom has a large closet, and provides for plenty of space for clothing, accessories, and storage. The master bedroom closet has built-in sliding shoe-racks and drawers for maximal space and efficiency.
The lobby is sleek and sophisticated, and the building boasts Jack London Square's best rooftop deck with built-in BBQ, kitchen, dining, and lounging areas. The home is wired for internet access at 100 Mbps and is serviced by Webpass. Lease includes 2 tandem parking spaces located within the secured garage.
The home is located half a mile from two BART stations and the ferry terminal, which provide options for quick access into the surrounding areas and to San Francisco. Yes, there's more! There is a free bus one block away that runs from Jack London up through Oakland downtown/Uptown and provides easy access to those areas without driving or walking. In addition, Amtrak provides easy access to the East and South Bay, and is a great way for out of town visitors to comfortably arrive within a block of your home. Lastly, the home is within 30 minutes of San Francisco International Airport and just a short 10 minute drive to the Oakland International Airport.
Jack London provides proximity to thriving businesses and entertainment districts. Oakland's First Fridays, Yoshi's, the nightlife of Uptown, Chinatown, and the historic Old Oakland district are all easily within reach. Within Jack London itself, fine dining options exist, (Lungomare, Scotts), numerous casual dining options (Chophouse, Nido, Oakland Grill, and Forge Pizza to name our favorites), wineries (10 individual wineries on the Urban Wine Trail), beer gardens and breweries (Federation Brewing, Independent Brewing). Jack London provides easy access to the Oakland Estuary Boardwalk, and the waterfront provides multiple festivals and events throughout the year (weekly, year-round farmer's market, Eat Real Fest, Jack of All Trades, Oakland Bacon and Beer Fest, Pedalfest).

A nationally designated historic landmark built in Oakland, CA in 1912, the masonry building was designed as an incandescent light bulb factory owned by General Electric, notable for being the first factory to employ women on the West Coast.
Now redefined and newly restored, Lampwork Lofts has 92 apartments for rent that will inspire you with open spaces soaring 14 to 25' high, original oak beam ceilings and exposed brick walls, and gorgeous windows with views of San Francisco and downtown Oakland. We hope to make Lampwork Lofts your new home.

Hello,
This home has 3-4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room, family room, kitchen, rumpus room, backyard, attached garage, driveway parking and street parking.  Lots of light.  Easy access to freeway (580).  This home is in the Allendale neighborhood below 580 at Eastman and Culver.  The house is located on a wide street with great neighbors who all own their homes.  Open layout for kitchen/dining/family rooms.  The bathrooms are both remodeled, fresh paint throughout, some new flooring, hard wood, etc., etc.
This home feels good.  
Pets are negotiable.  That said, I love pets...  No cigarette smoking in the house.
There are still a few light fixtures to hang and some other minor items.  A flagstone patio is being set up in the back and all can be ready by 2/8/19 if necessary.
Shown by appointment only.  I do plan to show it tomorrow/Sunday as well.  Email for details.
Thanks!    ",37.7878,-122.1884,"2019-02-02T17:37:54-0800","2019-02-11T12:30:26-0800","4BR / 2Ba","_eby_apa_d_oakland-lots-of-sun-remodeled-awesome_6810325690.html",4,2,1564

Come live in a cute cottage in my backyard! You'll have your own gated entrance to the place. The space offers privacy with access to the backyard and garden. I am looking to create a community and am seeking folks who are interested in engaging and fostering relationships in this living arrangement.
The neighborhood is great. It's a short walk to the MacArthur BART. There is a Ford bike station one block away, and the F bus one block away as well, which takes you directly to San Francisco. The neighborhood offers restaurants nearby and is very close to the shopping in Emeryville. 
The rent is $2100 per month, plus utilities. The security deposit is 1.5x rent. Move-in date is flexible (as soon as you want). Plenty of street parking. Couples and dogs are welcome. 
**The furniture shown in the pictures is not included in the home. However, there will be a refrigerator in the unit (not pictured).

This  Townhouse High up in the Oakland Hills has some additional upgrades which have created a very nice environment for you to live in. It is 4bd/3ba with Three Levels.  It also has an awesome View of the Bay. It  has a nice back yard where you can spend some great time with your kids or  pets.  The daily commute to SF is nice because a special A/C transit bus goes there every Morning (M-F) Non-Stop; also, from this Townhouse you can get to the freeways of  #580 and #13 in about 30 SECONDS. The HOA has a recreational room whereby you can do regular exercises along with playgrounds and many streets just to walk on that you may like to do.  
This is a wonderful part of the City of Oakland which is the hometown of the current World-Champion Oakland Warriors who are now looking forward to a Three-Peat this year; and it is also the hometown of the Oakland Raiders who will leave soon.   Our phenomenal  Oakland Zoo is only a hop, skip and a couple of jumps away.  This would be a nice place to come home to after work.

****TAKING APPLICATIONS NOW*****
APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. Goldstone Management won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure all lease term of 12 months. A 6 month lease may be available on higher monthly rent payments.
9) We require the residents to provide a copy of renter's insurance. Goldstone Management must be listed as ""Additional Insured"" and general liability should be $100,000 with a maximum deductible of $1,000. If you do not have renter's insurance we can provide you with a link to a company many of our residents use for low cost insurance.
Thank you for your attention to all of the above.",37.814728,-122.253714,"2019-01-22T13:51:47-0800","2019-02-11T18:56:36-0800","1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_oakland-newly-remodeled-1bathroom_6801417410.html",1,1,900

Believe it! These townhomes were carefully designed to make shared living a joy.  You can get your own bedroom in a brand new 3 bdrm townhome with a real kitchen and great room for less half the price of a one bedroom microunit.  Each bedroom is private with it's own closet, storage, HVAC and internet.   Share with friends and save a bundle. More space.  More options. And definitely a lot cooler.
The Temescal Muse offers a different approach to apartment living.  It's's not a building.  It's a neighborhood of discrete town homes wrapped around an Italian street scene.  There are no corridors, only gathering places: courtyards, terraces, and private rooftop patios. Discover the efficiency of french balconies, even if you're not French.  These are town homes with a personality...yours.  We created a place, not a room number.  It feels like a home because it is.
Small and friendly is the answer to big and institutional.
Each home has it's own identity, designed with flexibility built in. Sliding walls turn a dining area into a media room, private office, guest bedroom, or nursery.  Our 2 and 3 bedroom 2 story townhouses have lofty 10'-6"" ceilings in the great room, with modern chef's kitchens featuring stainless steel appliances, plenty of storage space, pantries, and even guest powder rooms and baths.  Upstairs are 2 or more bedrooms, with 1 or more full baths, generous walk in closets, and a front loading laundry center in each unit sized for families.
Convenient, covered, secure parking is available for cars and bikes in the garage.
The Temescal Muse is connected to everything, even other people.  It's a sun baked Mediterranean Village within walking distance of the rest of the world. Three blocks to the dozens of restaurants and shops on Piedmont Avenue.  Not to mention the Piedmont theater.  Two blocks to the Kaiser Center. Four blocks to Bart and you are linked to the whole Bay Area.  It's closer to downtown San Francisco than most of San Francisco.
Downstairs is ""Bierhaus"", a Mountain View favorite watering hole now coming to The Temescal. It's Oakland's word for friendly and everyone's ""third space"" for dining (with or without) dogs around beerhall tables featuring great comfort food, pizza, brat, and brew.  Honest food for honest friends.  Honestly.  In fact it's a place so good you can take it with you.  Drop in on the way home to ""Take out dinner"" after a hard day work.  It's like having your own chef and they clean up.

If you want to live in a highly productive environment, you've come to the right place. 
We have a brand new building looking for our first round of tenants :) 
The unit is live work so you could set up a business out of this space and live here to save money!   The building is awesome and the living room has this HUGE skylight .  So much natural light and exposed reclaimed wood from the 30s.  The building has a Roof deck you gotta check out.
The location is in between West Oakland and Uptown Oakland.   Which is perfect for pricing and walkability.  The 19th Bart station is not even a 10 min walk away.   
We have parking options and bike storage in the building.  
 Have too much stuff? Don't worry, The building has an extra storage unit you can use for free.   
Sounds too good to be true?   Well out of the 24 units in the whole building we only have 2 left so this opportunity is almost off the market.  Schedule a tour through the link below to check it out before its gone :)

An amazing opportunity to rent a large single-family home on a huge lot in one of the most central parts of Oakland. This fully furnished home is for rent from March 1 to March 27th. Please email us for details.
With a Walkscore of 90 (""walkers paradise""), we are less than two blocks from Lower Piedmont Avenue. We are easily walkable to Piedmont shops and restaurants such as Chow and Commis, as well as Uptown institutions such as Firebrand and Drake's. 19th Street BART is a 15-minute walk or 5-minute bike ride away.
Ours is a very special old house designed for indoor/outdoor living. It is located on a big wooded lot, part of a leafy pocket neighborhood centered around Oak Glen Park and Glen Echo Creek. The creek runs through our front yard. 
Recently extensively renovated, the 1914 home has historic details intact: original oak floors and wood paneling, doors, and windows. The first floor has an open plan, with the kitchen flowing into an oversized dining room with large banquet table, which flows into the living room through vintage pocket doors. The new kitchen--with Carrera marble countertops, a deep porcelain double sink, an induction cooktop, convection oven, and pull-out custom cabinetry--is a happy place for cooks.
On the second floor there are two very large bedrooms and large study (optional third bedroom) with an attached balcony. There is one enormous bathroom finished in natural stone, marble, and hand-painted tiles. It boasts a frameless glass shower, a new cast-iron tub, a marble sink with ample storage, and located in a separate alcove, a tankless Japanese bidet toilet. 
The 13,000-square-foot lot is dotted with mature oaks, a very necessary hammock, two outdoor couches located around a fireplace, a patio area with a very large outdoor dining table, a smaller table in the front-yard flower garden, and a bench that overlooks the creek. 
The yard itself is landscaped with native water plants and woodland plants and FOOD: mature avocado, meyer lemon, orange trees, also American sour cherry, Turkish cherries, pink and red-fleshed apples, raspberries, blueberries, boysenberries, strawberries, blackberries, pomegranates, figs, currants, and all manner of herbs. There are great big redwoods surrounding us too, but we didn't grow those.
The driveway provides parking for two cars front to back. You will also have use of the attached garage and basement, where the laundry room is located.
The house comes with cable TV and wireless internet. We will require a security deposit. 
If interested, send us an email about yourself. Will follow up w/ a viewing.    ",37.819351,-122.259135,"2019-01-25T09:37:42-0800","2019-02-12T06:58:48-0800","3BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_oakland-remodeled-furnished-house_6803632779.html",3,1,2000

****TAKING APPLICATIONS NOW*****
APPLICATION PROCESS (please read):
1) All Applications must be filled out online and Application Fees paid through the LINK BELOW before they can be processed. One Application per person over the age of 18 please.
2) All supporting documents such as pay-stubs, IDs, current and past rental history with phone numbers must be attached to the online application please.
3) All the documents must be submitted before we process an application.
4) Submitting an application would require paying an application fee. This fee won't be refunded whether we run your credit or not since the company we contract with would not issue refunds and the money goes to them and not us. So if you genuinely like the apartment, apply. Please set clear expectations before applying. We don't want your application fees and we encourage people not to randomly apply and pay an application fee that they cannot recover. 
5) We are 100% transparent and believe in full disclosures. Every once in a while an error may creep into one of our advertisements even after we proof and re-proof an ad. We in no way intend to make any misrepresentations and attempt to correct any errors as soon as we are notified. Also, we often must rely on the words of a property owner for various items listed in our posts. Goldstone Management won't accept any responsibility if any such errors appear into our advertisements.
All square footage is approximate. At times pictures may be of a similar unit and not necessarily of the unit being advertised.
When in doubt, please ask questions until you are fully satisfied. 
6) We look at all applications on a first come, first serve basis based on qualifications. We are an equal opportunity housing provider.
7) Upon being approved, we require a holding deposit (by 1pm of the next business day) which is part of your move-in deposit so that we would hold the apartment for you. At that time, we remove the ad and email you a lease. 
8) We structure all lease term of 12 months. A 6 month lease may be available on higher monthly rent payments.
9) We require the residents to provide a copy of renter's insurance. Goldstone Management must be listed as ""Additional Insured"" and general liability should be $100,000 with a maximum deductible of $1,000. If you do not have renter's insurance we can provide you with a link to a company many of our residents use for low cost insurance.

The Temescal Muse offers a different approach to apartment living.  It's's not a building.  It's a neighborhood of discrete town homes wrapped around an Italian street scene.  There are no corridors, only gathering places: courtyards, terraces, and private rooftop patios. Discover the efficiency of french balconies, even if you're not French.  These are town homes with a personality...yours.  We created a place, not a room number.  It feels like a home because it is.
Small and friendly is the answer to big and institutional.
Each home has it's own identity, designed with flexibility built in. A spacious Great Room combines a chef's kitchen with a dining area, media room, private office, conversation seating area.  Our 2 bedroom 2 story townhouses have lofty 10'-6"" ceilings in the great room, with modern chef's kitchens featuring stainless steel appliances, plenty of storage space, pantries, and even guest powder rooms and baths.  Upstairs are 2 bedrooms, with a full baths, generous walk in closets, and a front loading laundry center in each unit sized for families.
Convenient, covered, secure parking is available for cars and bikes in the garage.
The Temescal Muse is connected to everything, even other people.  It's a sun baked Mediterranean Village within walking distance of the rest of the world. Three blocks to the dozens of restaurants and shops on Piedmont Avenue.  Not to mention the Piedmont theater.  Two blocks to the Kaiser Center. Four blocks to Bart and you are linked to the whole Bay Area.  It's closer to downtown San Francisco than most of San Francisco.
Downstairs is ""Bierhaus"", a Mountain View favorite watering hole now coming to The Temescal. It's Oakland's word for friendly and everyone's ""third space"" for dining (with or without) dogs around beerhall tables featuring great comfort food, pizza, brat, and brew.  Honest food for honest friends.  Honestly.  In fact it's a place so good you can take it with you.  Drop in on the way home to ""Take out dinner"" after a hard day work.  It's like having your own chef and they clean up.

One single occupancy furnished room in a house 2 ÃÂ½ blocks from Macarthur Bart. Sublet for February 14 until the end of month. Rent is $555 for the sublet period, and a $300 security deposit.
The house is spacious. Neighborhood is not quiet or trendy but is otherwise well-situated. Central location is ideal for commuters. The close proximity to BART will get you to San Francisco in 25 minutes. House is connected to bike paths that lead into Temescal, Piedmont, Emeryville, and Downtown Oakland. 
House:
3 bd/1.5 ba, 2 large furnished living rooms and full size kitchen. House includes a basement which has an additional bathroom, and a large backyard set up with 2 planter boxes. New wood laminate flooring through living areas, shower has a tub, and kitchen appliances are ~10 years old. Washer and dryer are in the basement/first story. No one pays for cable, but we have HBO and Netflix setup on a TV if you wanted to watch something there. 
People:
Four tenants (2 couples and 1 cat) will be staying. Unfortunately we are not looking to have another pet in the house. We enjoy cooking and tend to cook pretty often and keep a stocked kitchen. We have converted a corner of the basement to a music studio as well a leather workshop. We prefer a relatively quiet and reasonably clean house since everyone has differing work schedules--being as early as 6am. 
One thing to note is that the shower is located in a Jack-and-Jill bathroom (with 3 doors) situation meaning the other two occupied rooms are connected to the bathroom and requires us to be cognizant of its use.
Some of us drink occasionally and are 420 friendly. Not super regularly or a lot by any means, but if you are sensitive about that sort of thing then it might not be a good fit for you.

This is a newly remodeled, large 2 bedroom, 1 bath, with a dining and living area with lots of natural light.  This unit is the lower level of a house in Montclair with a private deck and separate entrance.  The house is nestled on the side a valley and the deck has expansive views of hillsides and eucalyptus trees. 
The kitchen has a refrigerator, sink and lots of cabinet space - but it does not have a stove or oven.  The last tenant used a microwave, toaster oven and hot plate and she loved the place. 
The ideal renter would be a quiet, conscientious person who requires a calm, serene place without large/complex cooking needs.
Parking is on the street and washer and dryer are located in the common use garage. 
Rent is $1950/ month $100 additional for all utilities ( WiFi, Electric, Garbage and water).

What was once iron and steel industrial space is now reincarnated into a special loft unique to Oakland. This 2 bedroom 2 bathroom unit is special in that the rooms are within rooms, as specially placed divider walls and quasi-ceilings give this space both privacy and a unique flavor. There are plenty of windows which carry much natural light. 
The kitchen comes equipped with modern stainless steel appliances with plenty of space for a table setting. The unit is equipped with a stacked washer/dryer, and 2 parking spaces in the private lot. There is also a nice little front yard space as well.

Description:
Community

The Temescal Muse offers a different approach to apartment living.ÃÂ  
It's's not a building.ÃÂ  It's a neighborhood of discrete town homes wrapped 
around an Italian street scene.ÃÂ  There are no corridors, only gathering 
places: courtyards, terraces, and private rooftop patios. Discover the 
efficiency of french balconies, even if you're not French.ÃÂ  These are town 
homes with a personality...yours.ÃÂ  We created a place, not a room number.ÃÂ  
It feels like a home because it is.

Small and friendly is the answer to big and institutional.

Each home has it's own identity, designed with flexibility built in. 
Sliding walls turn a dining area into a media room, private office, guest 
bedroom, or nursery.ÃÂ  Our 2 story townhouses have lofty 10'-6"" ceilings in 
the great room, with modern chef's kitchens featuring stainless steel 
appliances, plenty of storage space, pantries, and even guest powder rooms 
and baths.ÃÂ  Upstairs are 2 or more bedrooms, with 1 or more full baths, 
generous walk in closets, and a front loading laundry center in each unit 
sized for families.

Connected

Internet is included (it is the 21st century) and convenient, covered, 
secure parking is available for cars and bikes in the garage.

The Temescal Muse is connected to everything, even other people.ÃÂ  It's a 
sun baked Mediterranean Village within walking distance of the rest of the 
world. Three blocks to the dozens of restaurants and shops on Piedmont 
Avenue.ÃÂ  Not to mention the Piedmont theater.ÃÂ  Two blocks to the Kaiser 
Center. Four blocks to Bart and you are linked to the whole Bay Area.ÃÂ  It's 
closer to downtown San Francisco than most of San Francisco.

Downstairs is ""Bierhaus"", a Mountain View 
favorite watering hole now coming to The Temescal. It's Oakland's word for 
friendly and everyone's ""third space"" for dining (with or without) dogs 
around beerhall tables featuring great comfort food, pizza, brat, and brew.ÃÂ  
Honest food for honest friends.ÃÂ  Honestly.ÃÂ  In fact it's a place so good 
you can take it with you.ÃÂ  Drop in on the way home to ""Take out 
dinner"" after a hard day work.ÃÂ  It's like having your own chef and they 
clean up.

Why settle for ordinary?

All three bedrooms have a ceiling fan and their own exclusive closet space. The master and hallway bathrooms have been updated to a more modern taste.
The two balconies in the unit literally offer a breath of fresh air. One is located off the kitchen/living room area and the other one off the master bedroom. The unit comes equipped with stackable washer/dryer hook-ups, which gives the option to bring any desired laundry machine of your choosing. The attached garage serves best to park any car or simply utilize it as partial storage space.

The most imaginative Penthouse Townhouses in the East Bay are now the most Affordable.
Four spectacular and unique Townhome Penthouses each with private rooftop terraces overlooking the Golden East Bay Hills and the City of San Francisco sit atop The Temescal Muse.  They are part of The Muse's different approach to Urban Living.
The Temescal Muse rethinks apartment living.  It's not a building.  It's a neighborhood of discrete town homes wrapped around an Italian street scene.  There are no corridors, only gathering places: courtyards, terraces, and private rooftop patios. Discover the efficiency of french balconies, even if you're not French.  These are town homes with a personality...yours.  We created a place, not a room number.  It feels like a home because it is.
Small and friendly is the answer to big and institutional.
Each home has it's own identity, designed with flexibility built in. Sliding walls turn a dining area into a media room, private office, guest bedroom, or nursery.  Our 2 and 3 bedroom 2 story townhouses have lofty 10'-6"" ceilings in the great room, with modern chef's kitchens featuring stainless steel appliances, plenty of storage space, pantries, and even guest powder rooms and baths.  Upstairs are 2 or more bedrooms, with 1 or more full baths, generous walk in closets, and a front loading laundry center in each unit sized for families.
Convenient, covered, secure parking is available for cars and bikes in the garage.
The Temescal Muse is connected to everything, even other people.  It's a sun baked Mediterranean Village within walking distance of the rest of the world. Three blocks to the dozens of restaurants and shops on Piedmont Avenue.  Not to mention the Piedmont theater.  Two blocks to the Kaiser Center. Four blocks to Bart and you are linked to the whole Bay Area.  It's closer to downtown San Francisco than most of San Francisco.
Downstairs is ""Bierhaus"", a Mountain View favorite watering hole now coming to The Temescal. It's Oakland's word for friendly and everyone's ""third space"" for dining (with or without) dogs around beerhall tables featuring great comfort food, pizza, brat, and brew.  Honest food for honest friends.  Honestly.  In fact it's a place so good you can take it with you.  Drop in on the way home to ""Take out dinner"" after a hard day work.  It's like having your own chef and they clean up.

Reviews from previous stays:
""I loved my stay at this studio. It's well furnished, clean, and private. The hosts are very accommodating and easy to get in contact with. I highly recommend this charming spot."" - Andrea
""Last year, I embarked on a new career in San Francisco and needed a place to live for about 18 months. During my house search, I crossed with this owner's listing on Craigslist and knew immediately that was the place for me. The owners made me feel like I was home from day one, with their welcoming and details. I originally lived with them in San Francisco and then moved to their new house in Oakland; in both cases, the common areas and my space were well maintained and spacious, nothing to complain about. They are very respectful and responsible people, and their place is great as well. I will definitely recommend their house to anyone!"" - Rosi
""I really enjoyed staying in this spacious, sunny, newly-built studio. The amenities include a handy kitchenette, ample closet space, clawfoot tub/shower, and a patio area. I always prefer to get the feel of a city's neighborhoods and communities. Meeting 'real people' like the owners was also great; they were available to give me tips about local shops and restaurants. They are both very helpful and accommodating. I will definitely come back if I am in the Oakland area."" - Susan    ",37.785128,-122.225979,"2019-02-07T13:33:46-0800",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_oakland-your-own-fully-furnished-studio_6814039637.html",1,1,225

Reviews from previous stays:
""I loved my stay at this studio. It's well furnished, clean, and private. The hosts are very accommodating and easy to get in contact with. I highly recommend this charming spot."" - Andrea
""Last year, I embarked on a new career in San Francisco and needed a place to live for about 18 months. During my house search, I crossed with this owner's listing on Craigslist and knew immediately that was the place for me. The owners made me feel like I was home from day one, with their welcoming and details. I originally lived with them in San Francisco and then moved to their new house in Oakland; in both cases, the common areas and my space were well maintained and spacious, nothing to complain about. They are very respectful and responsible people, and their place is great as well. I will definitely recommend their house to anyone!"" - Rosi
""I really enjoyed staying in this spacious, sunny, newly-built studio. The amenities include a handy kitchenette, ample closet space, clawfoot tub/shower, and a patio area. I always prefer to get the feel of a city's neighborhoods and communities. Meeting 'real people' like the owners was also great; they were available to give me tips about local shops and restaurants.

This 1342-square-foot live/work artist's loft is located in the historic Clawson School built in 1917.  The pride of Oakland's school system for 52 years, this grand building features art deco brick-and-molded-terracotta facade detail rare to find in a residential setting.  This ground-floor loft features high ceilings throughout and beautiful brick-work on several walls.  With its sunny Southern exposure and large double-paned windows, the warm daytime natural light creates the perfect atmosphere for a creative tenant.  Create your own living layout in this spacious unit that is plenty large enough for a couple.  No one is living below, above or around you in the large main space, which gives you the freedom to work late or watch movies at any hour of the night, making this a truly unique environment.   The unit's parking space is 5 feet from your large back door that opens into the secure parking area.  This is the only unit in the building that has an original fireplace (non operational). Right above, a sun-drenched deck enables you to sit or barbecue outdoors.  A very large bathroom has a washer dryer, new toilet and shower tub combo. Just outside, apple, peach and Asian pears produce fruit in season and lemon trees offer their bounty year-round.  This unit has tons of soul and emits creative energy from the solid concrete that schooled young people for 50 years! They can't build buildings like this anymore. 
Please note that some of the photos in this posting are from when loft had different wall paint~

Some more info on history of the building:
In 1971, Clawson was the center of Superintendent Marcus Foster's partnership with UC Berkeley working to improve education for low-income students.  In the mid-1970's, the building became Oakland's foray into creating a public school dedicated to the arts. Dogtown Developers purchased the building from Oakland Unified School District in 1999, after it closed in 1979, and renovated it to create these unique and amazing live/work lofts.",37.824616,-122.282832,"2019-02-06T00:19:12-0800",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_eby_apa_d_one-of-kind-stunning-loft-for-rent_6812715188.html",1,1,1342

    This large open-concept two-level 2 bedroom plus bonus room, 2 bathroom townhome features a bonus room great for use as a guest room, den, or office. The home is well lit and has beautiful modern dark gray wood-patterned luxury vinyl tile (LVT) floors; high ceilings; quadruple-pane windows; forced air conditioning and heating; a large deck with views of Point Richmond; and a full-size washer and gas dryer in the unit. The modern open kitchen has a Caesarstone quartz countertop and backsplash and stainless steel GE appliances including a gas range. The large bathroom has high-end finishes and a tub. The apartment is uber-efficient with a Navien tankless gas hot water heater, LED lighting, and spray foam insulation for superior sound insulation and temperature regulation.

Point Richmond is a gem, enjoying a historic small-town feel with quaint coffee shops, beaches, shops, restaurants, and even an old-fashioned barber.

The condo gets a lot of natural light, there are canals with water fountains throughout the grounds of the complex so there is always a calming sound of wildlife (birds) and water. However the sounds are not ""noisy"" and cannot be heard if the windows are closed. The complex is gated, and the unit is near the entrance so its a short stroll to the gym, yoga room, pool, and tennis courts. Parking space included. 
The condo is about a 5 minute walk to the Marina which has a walking trail that leads you all the way down to Berkeley and Emeryville. It's about a 7-10 min drive to Point Richmond, which has tons of restaurants and cafes, and about 8-10 miles north of Berkeley and where you can easily find nightlife, food scenes, and urban comforts. Great location for commuters too! https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/richmond-sched
