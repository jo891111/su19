    "In this homework, we will go through the iterative process of specifying, fitting, and analyzing the performance of a  model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first portion of the assignment, we will guide you through some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Next, you will add a new feature to the dataset, before specifying and fitting a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict housing prices. Finally, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.\n",

    "After this homework, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",

    "1. Simple feature engineering\n",
    "1. Using sklearn to build linear models\n",
    "1. Building a data pipeline using pandas\n",

The data set has 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers) --- 82 features in total.  An explanation of each variable can be found in the included `codebook.txt` file.
